function Delta_m = Rocket_Eqn(m_f, Delta_V, I_sp)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Rocket_Eqn
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, calculate the change in fuel mass
% required to perform a manoeuvre with a certain change in velocity.

% Inputs:
    % m_f:	Final mass after manoeuvre (kg)
    % Delta_V:	Change in velocity of manoeuvre (m/s)
    % I_sp:	Specific impulse (s)
 
% Outputs:
    % Delta_m:	Change in mass (kg) (i.e. mass of fuel burned for manoeuvre)

% Constants:
g = 9.81; % Earth Surface Gravity in m/s^2 (used as constant for calculating I_sp);

%% Calculate change in fuel mass for this manoevre

Delta_m = m_f*(1-exp(-(Delta_V/I_sp*g)));
