%% SPREADSHEET (EXCEL FILE) NAME from which to read Parameters, FE Model Definition, and Load Cases:
Filename = 'S3562932_S3369733_Design_File';

%% Material Properties
rho  = 2810;           % Element Material Density (kg/m^3)
E    = 7.17E+10;           % Element Material Young's Modulus (N/m^2)
failure_strength = 5.70e+8; % Element Material Yield/Ultimate/Failure Strength (N/m^2)

%% Parameters
Amin = 0.001; % Minimum cross-sectional area to test (m^2)
Amax = 0.005; % Maximum cross-sectional area to test (m^2)
nA = 10; % number of cross-sectional areas to check
n = 8; % Order of polynomial to fit to coarse data
safety_factor = 2; % Factor by which to divide yield strength to have maximum allowable stress
stress_allowed = failure_strength / safety_factor;
tolerance = 1e+6; % Convergence tolerance for bisection method, in units of stress (Pa)
maxiter = 100;    % Maximum number of iterations for bisection method

%% Activity 1 & 2: Call RunAnalysis for some input Area to test it and draw your truss structure
% (set plot_or_not to 1 to see your truss model and debug, via RunAnalysis calling DrawModel)
A = 0.002; % This shouldn't be here

plot_or_not = 1;

[peak_stress,m_Descent_Module_Fuel] = RunAnalysis(Filename, A, E, rho, plot_or_not);
plot_or_not = 0; 

% (set plot_or_not to 0 before you submit)

%% Activity 3:  Calculate & plot peak stress for different Cross-Sectional Areas (coarse)
% Define list of Cross-Sectional Areas to test
% (set plot_or_not to 0 before submitting, this script should only plot for optimal area found in Activity 5)

% For each Cross-Sectional Area, call RunAnalysis

for A = linspace(Amin,Amax,nA)
    [peak_stress,m_Descent_Module_Fuel] = RunAnalysis(Filename, A, E, rho, plot_or_not);
    figure 
    hold on
    plot(A, peak_stress, 'b')
    plot(max_allowable_stress, 'r')
    title('Area vs. Peak Stress')
    
    figure
    plot(A, m_Descent_Module_Fuel, 'b') 
end
 
% Plot data points on Area versus peak stress plot (figure 1)
% Plot red horizontal line at max_allowable_stress (figure 1)
% Plot data points on Area versus descent module fuel mass plot (figure 2)

%% Activity 4:  Create polynomial fit of coarse peak stress vs. Area data
% Check that order of polynomial to fit is below number of data points

if length(A)<n+1
    error('Error: the order of polynomial to fit is below the number of data points, pleaase re-enter values');
end

% Fit polynomial to data, getting list of coefficients
% Plot polynomial fit on figure 1

for i=1:1:count
    if abs (poly(1)) > tolerance
        poly = polyfit(A,peak_stress,i);
        interp_x2=polyval(poly,x2);
        plot(i, interp_x2, 'bo')
        figure
        hold on
        plot(x,y,'bo')

    end
end

%% Activity 5: Use bisection method to find root of a function g = polyval() - stress_allowed
% Define function g whose root is the intersection of peak stress and max allowable stress 

fun = @(g) 1; % !!! this needs changing_________!!!
% Calculate initial lower limit for bisection (largest area with peak stress > allowable stress)

% Plot vertical line at initial lower limit
% Calculate initial upper limit for bisection (smallest area with peak stress < allowable stress)
% Plot vertical line at initial upper limit

% Call Bisection function to perform bisection method on g, getting list of (x,y) points at each iteration of the process

[x_list,y_list] = Bisection(fun, a, b, maxiter, tolerance);

% Plot optimal point found by bisection (x = A_opt, y = peak stress at A_opt according to fitted polynomial)

% Call RunAnalysis for A_opt, getting exact peak stress at A_opt, "peak_stress_opt" (plot_or_not==1)

% Plot this exact optimal point as a green x on descent module fuel mass vs area plot (figure 2)

% Plot this exact optimal point as a green x on bisection stress vs area plot (figure 3)
