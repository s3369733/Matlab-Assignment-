%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Bisection
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function uses the bisection method to find the root of an input function, fun.

% Inputs:
    % fun:          Function of which to find roots (i.e. where f(inputs) = 0)
    % a:            Initial lower limit for bisection method
    % b:            Initial upper limit for bisection method
    % maxiter:      Maximum number of iterations the bisection can run
    % tolerance:    Convergence tolerance of bisection
    
% Outputs:
    % x_list:       x-coordinate ("s") of each point along the process (not just the final one).
    % y_list:       y-coordinate ("fun(s)") of each point along the process (not just the final one).

%% Check inputs 
% Do a and b bracket a root and are not themselves roots?

while ((fun(a)*fun(b))>0)
    fprintf('\n Invalid selection of a and b. Please try again. \n\n');
end

% Are maxiter and tolerance positive?

while (maxiter<0)
    fprintf('Invalid selection for maximum number of intervals, please enter a positive value');
end

while (tolerance<0)
    fprintf('Invalid selection for tolerance, please enter a positive value'); 
end

%% Main bisection algorithm loop

x_list=(a+b)/2;
n=1;
while abs(b-a)>tolerance
    if (fun(a)*fun(b)<0)
        b=x_list(n);
    else 
        a=x_list(n);
    end
    
n=n+1;
x_list(n+1)=(a+b)/2;
